This project I did with my schoolmate in 2020.
It was my first game which I pushed to itch.io. This is endless runner for kids.
The idea was to create small game in a short time and load it in to shop.
My part of this work was to do all mechanics. My mate did all part of art.
Also we wanted to do android version, but we didn't have enough time.
I practised working in short period and concentrate on game's focus group.
